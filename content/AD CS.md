#### Introduction

- **Active Directory Certificate Services** (AD CS) enables use of Microsoft's own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in an active directory forest.
- AD CS helps in authenticating users and machines, encrypting and signing documents, filesystems, emails and more.
- A good attack vector since certificates **can** survive credential rotation, it also proves as a good persistence mechanism.

#### Elements of AD CS

- CA - The **certification authority** that issues certificates. The server with AD CS role (DC or separate) is the CA
- Certificate - Issued to a user or machine and can be used for authentication, encryption, signing etc.
- Certificate Template - a collection of settings and policies that defines how and when a certificate may be issued by a CA. It is typically created by an Administrator.
- CSR - **Certificate Signing Request** made by a client to the CA to request a signed certificate.
- Certificate Template - Defines settings for a certificate. Contains information like enrollment permissions, EKUs, expiry etc.
- EKU OIDs - **Extended Key Usages** Object Identifiers. These dictate the use of a certificate template (Client authentication, Smart Card Logon, SubCA etc.)

#### Abuse

- Extract user and machine certificates
- Use certificates to retrieve NTLM hash
- User and machine level persistence
- Escalation to Domain Admin and Enterprise Admin
- Domain Persistence
