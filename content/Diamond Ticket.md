- A diamond ticket is created by decrypting a valid TGT, making changes to it and re-encrypt it using the AES keys of the krbtgt account
- This, like Golden Ticket, deals with abusing TGS-REQ
- Golden ticket was a TGT forging attack whereas diamond ticket is a TGT modification attack.
- The persistence lifetime will depend on the krbtgt account.
- A diamond ticket is more opsec safe as it has:
	- Valid ticket times because a TGT issued by the DC is modified.
	- In golden ticket, there is no corresponding TGT request for TGS/Service ticket requests as the TGT is forged.
