- A relationship between two domains or forests which allows users of one domain or forest to access resources in the other domain or forest.
- Trust can be automatic or established (forest, external)
- Trusted Domain Objects (TDOs) represent the trust relationships in a domain.
- Trust Direction:
  - One-way trust - unidirectional. Users in the trusted domain can access resources in the trusting domain but the reverse is not true.
  - Two way trust - bi-directional. Users of both domains can access resources in the other domain.
- Trust types:
  - Transitive - Can be extended to establish trust relationships with other domains.
    - All the default intra-forest trust relationships (Tree-root, Parent-Child) between domains within a same forest are transitive two-way trusts.
  - Non-transitive - Cannot be extended to other domains in the forest. Can be two-way or one-way
    - This is the default trust (called external trust) between two domains in different forests when forests do not have a trust relationship.
- Default/Automatic Trusts
  - Parent-child trust
    - It is created automatically between the new domain and the domain that precedes it in the namespace hierarchy, whenever a new domain is added in a tree.
    - This trust is always two-way transitive.
  - Tree-root trust
    - It is created automatically between whenever a new domain tree is added to a forest root.
    - This trust is always two-way transitive.
- Non-default/Established Trusts
  - External Trusts
    - Between two domains in different forests when forests do not have a trust relationship.
    - Can be one-way or two-way and is nontransitive.
  - Forest Trusts
    - Between forest root domain.
    - Cannot be extended to a third forest (no implicit trust).
    - Can be one-way or two-way transitive.
