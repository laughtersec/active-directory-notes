```powershell title:"Supply data to BloodHound (Remember to bypass .NET AMSI)"
. C:\AD\Tools\BloodHound-master\Collectors\SharpHound.ps1
Invoke-BloodHound -CollectionMethod All
```

Or just use SharpHound.exe

```powershell title:"Make collection stealthy. Removes noisy collection methods like RDP,DCOM,PSRemote and LocalAdmin"
Invoke-BloodHound -Stealth
```

```batch
SharpHound.exe --Stealth
```

```powershell title:"To avoid detections like MDI"
Invoke-BloodHound -ExcludeDCs
```

- Run the collector on your foothold and a zip file will be generated
- Import the zip file in BloodHound

Of course there won't be times where we will have the luxury to upload things manually. Here is a linux tool for the same:

```shell
bloodhound-ce-python -d domain.com -u 'domain.user' -p 'itspassword' -dc dc01.domain.com -ns dc-ip -c All --zip
```

[Bloodhound CE is the latest version used. ](https://www.kali.org/tools/bloodhound-ce-python/)
